# Graph_Coloring_Undergrad_Project_2015
Graph Coloring project is about to study and present the already existing graph coloring algorithms and analyzing the heuristics, properties and time complexities of different algorithms like Greedy coloring, Sequential coloring, Largest Degree coloring, Incidence Degree Coloring, Saturation Degree Coloring, Independent Set Coloring and Graph coloring by Domination Vertex Covering(DOM). Comparing the output chromatic number(c(G)) given by the algorithms for the various benchmark graphs. To discuss different applications of graph coloring in real time problems and their implementation
